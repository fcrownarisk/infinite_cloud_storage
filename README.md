# infinite_cloud_storage

    Visual Basic .net to Visulize the spacetime mass bending
  
    illustrate basic principle theory 
   
    based on Extended String Theory (E A D G B E) and Quantum Loop Theory (spin boson fermion supersysmetry)

    seize the power of Dark Matter consuming the Dark Energy to increase itself(D M)

    So that we can provide almost endless storage in steam cloud without server running on the local machine(SSD = Solid State Drive)
